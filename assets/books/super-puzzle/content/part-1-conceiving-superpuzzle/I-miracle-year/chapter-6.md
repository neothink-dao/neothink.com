## 🔄 Consciousness Evolution Theory

### The Three Mentalities (Based on Julian Jaynes)
1. **Bicameral Mind (3000+ years ago)**:
   - Automatic, mimicked reactions
   - No internal mind space for independent thinking
   - Gods/voices provided all guidance

2. **Current Self-Conscious Mind (1000 BC - Present)**:
   - Internal mind space for thinking and decision-making
   - Self-controlling, self-determining mentality
   - Evolved under survival pressures as bicameral mind became inadequate

3. **Neothink/God-Man Mentality (Future)**:
   - Puzzle-building creates even greater internal mind space
   - Beyond current thinking tools like metaphors and analog models
   - Can take every field of knowledge to the next level
   - Can create entirely new fields and magnificent values

### The 3000-Year Cycle
