# Chapter 23: The Marketing Revolution - Prophetic Visions and Prison Laboratory üöÄüìà

## üìñ Chapter Overview

Chapter 23 reveals how separation catalyzes unprecedented breakthroughs for both the students and Mr. Melbourne. The students deliver a prophetic Christmas tape predicting the explosive growth of personal computers through Moore's Law and the geometric technological advancement possible in unregulated industries.
