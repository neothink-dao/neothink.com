```
Dependencies: None

Process:
1. Export list of 80 noindexed URLs from GSC
2. Review each URL's purpose
3. Check WordPress Yoast settings for each
4. Determine if noindex is intentional:

   - Thank-you pages - Keep noindex ✓
   - Test/staging pages - Keep noindex ✓
   - Valuable content - Remove noindex
5. Document findings

Action Items:
□ Keep strategic noindex tags
□ Remove accidental noindex tags

Expected Outcome:
- 20-30 pages improved and indexed
- 20-30 pages deleted/noindexed (not valuable)
- 10-20 pages merged/redirected

Success Criteria:
