## üîÑ TIMELINE PHILOSOPHY CHANGES

### Before: Arbitrary Time-Based
```
‚ùå "Day 1-2: Do X"
‚ùå "Week 1: Do Y"
‚ùå "30 days: Expect Z"
```

### After: Logic & Dependency-Based
```
‚úÖ "Step 1: [Action] - Dependencies: None"
‚úÖ "Step 2: [Action] - Dependencies: Step 1 complete"
‚úÖ "Monitor after 2-4 weeks (indexing time)"
‚úÖ "Monthly review: First week of each month"
```

### When Timelines ARE Used
- **Natural cycles:** Daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly
- **Technical constraints:** "2-4 weeks for Google indexing"
- **Measurement periods:** "30+ days for sufficient data"

### When Timelines are NOT Used
- Arbitrary "Day 1-5" plans
- Forced "Week 1-8" schedules
- Unrealistic "complete in 30 days" promises
