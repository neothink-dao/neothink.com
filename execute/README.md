# Execution Plans

Dependency-based action plans for SEO optimization.

## Current Focus

- **[priority-actions.md](priority-actions.md)** - Phase-based implementation plan with dependencies

## How to Use

1. Start with priority-actions.md for complete implementation framework
2. Follow dependency-based phases (Phase 1 → Phase 2 → Phase 3 → Phase 4 → Phase 5)
3. Check completion criteria before moving to next phase
4. Reference [../STATUS.md](../STATUS.md) for current performance metrics

## Archive

Previous time-based execution plans have been moved to [archive/](archive/) for reference. The new priority-actions.md uses dependency-based logic instead of arbitrary timelines.
