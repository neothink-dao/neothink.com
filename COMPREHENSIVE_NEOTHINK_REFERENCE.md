## üéØ **THE THREE CORE HUMAN TYPES**

*The Neothink philosophy identifies three fundamental evolutionary states that align with the three community platforms: Value Creators (Ascenders), Integrated Thinkers (Neothinkers), and Self-Leaders (Immortals).*

### **1. VALUE CREATORS (Ascenders Platform - Prosperity)**

#### **Essence and Identity**
- **Core Definition**: The fundamental identity and purpose of a human being who has made the evolutionary leap from stagnation to an exhilarating, self-directed life of prosperity
- **Human Essence**: The essence of man is CREATION‚ÄîVALUE CREATION. The human mind is the only thing on Earth that can create
- **The Person You Were Meant to Be**: Being a value creator is the person every human being was meant to be
- **God-Man Harmony**: Value creation puts an individual in harmony with Zon (consciousness throughout the Universe), whose ultimate desire is to see creation beget creators

#### **Function: How Value Creators Operate**
**Transition from Value Producer ‚Üí Value Creator:**

| Value Producer (Stagnation) | Value Creator (Exhilaration) |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Following mode; bicameral-like mentality | Integrated thinking; self-leader mode |
| Specialized thinking; routine tasks as ends in themselves | Integrated thinking; continually growing puzzle-pictures |
| Stuck in stagnant routine-rut or job of labor | Open-ended vector of value creation; mini-company structure |
| Suffers from stagnation, burden of life | Experiences exhilaration, euphoria, happiness |

#### **Key Transformation Mechanisms**
- **Playing as an Adult**: For adults, creating values is how they play - the mental makeup of the rich
- **Friday-Night Essence (FNE)**: Taps into deepest motivational root, generating relentless downstream focus
- **Ten-Second Miracle (TSM)**: Spontaneous insights from numbers-based thinking that spark value creation
- **Division of Essence**: Evolution beyond division of labor - jobs become mini-companies integrating responsibility with money-making purpose

#### **Purpose and Rewards**
- **Financial**: Only way to become independently wealthy; bypasses all competition
- **Personal**: Brings wealth, pride, and happiness; permanent immortal euphoria
- **Societal**: Greatest contributors to society - job creators and wealth creators
- **Spiritual**: The meaning of life; deep harmony with self, world, and Universe

### **2. INTEGRATED THINKERS (Neothinkers Platform - Happiness)**

#### **Definition and Nature**
- **Core Definition**: Individual who has made the evolutionary leap in mental functioning from specialized following mind to creative integrating mind
- **Mental Evolution**: Second major evolution of human mind (first was bicameral to conscious mind in ancient Greece)
- **Purpose**: Mind is designed for dynamic integrated thinking, not static routine thinking

#### **Mechanisms of Integrated Thinking**

**1. Common Denominators and Concepts (Foundation)**
- **Conceptual Thinking**: Integrating random percepts (five senses) into structured concepts
- **Knowledge Retention**: Forms few large concepts instead of memorizing many specific percepts
- **Mental Architecture**: Structures knowledge through common denominators

**2. Puzzle-Building (Application)**
- **Knowledge Integration**: Snapping together knowledge like puzzle pieces
- **Puzzle-Pictures**: As puzzle grows, picture forms even before all pieces are present
- **Future Vision**: Puzzle-picture is essentially seeing the future - describing missing portions with omnipotence
- **Creative Breakthroughs**: Completing puzzle-pictures results in new knowledge and creative insights

**3. Advanced Tools and Techniques**
- **Numbers-Integrating Mode**: Linking everything to numbers for advanced analysis
- **Power-Thinking**: Hard, integrated thinking for vast projects and future goals
- **Power-Concentration**: Burrowing into specifics until whole picture emerges
- **Power-Responsibility**: Feeling 100% responsible for projects to force integrating mode

#### **Consequences and Advantages**
- **Self-Leadership**: Internally guided, no external authority needed
- **Control and Certainty**: Iron-grip control over business with solid, certain decisions
- **Wealth and Creativity**: Breaks into value creation; becomes more creative than smartest people
- **Path to Neothink**: Integrated thinking becomes Neothink when conceptual advancements interlock into synergistic knowledge advancement

### **3. SELF-LEADERS (Immortals Platform - Longevity)**

#### **Identity and Essence**
- **Core Definition**: Individual who has achieved the evolutionary leap representing the person they were meant to be
- **Internal Authority**: Self-leader is their own authority with internal guidance
- **The Neothink Man**: Synonymous with person who has entered Neothink mentality
- **God-Man Evolution**: Ultimate result of overcoming bicameral-like mentality - becomes own guide and god
- **The Creator**: Defined as creator/value creator, constantly moving into exhilarating creation

#### **Function: Escaping the Following Mode**

| Following Mode (Non-Self-Leader) | Integrated Mode (Self-Leader) |
|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Stuck in routine rut with specialized, dead-end responsibilities | Open-ended vector of creation, constantly building wealth |
| Seeks external guidance from leaders, managers, politicians | Uses integrated thinking (Neothink) for self-guidance |
| Suffers from stagnation | Fueled by exhilaration |

#### **The Self-Leader System: Tools for Transformation**
**Five Core Steps:**

1. **Project Curiosity**: Acquire integrated knowledge about whole business/sphere of influence
2. **Self-Investment Plan**: Target money-making purposes and open-ended wealth-building mini-companies
3. **Investing In Oneself**: Master nitty-gritty details, absorb responsibilities for self-guidance evolution
4. **Overcoming Resistance**: Fight natural bicameral resistance to self-leadership for minimum 30 days
5. **Mind Muscle (Power Techniques)**: Seven Power Techniques to "muscle" mind into integrated thinking
   - **Power Approach**: Emotional state of determination and self-authority
   - **Power-Responsibility**: 100% responsibility feeling that removes externally guided openings

#### **Societal and Political Impact**
- **Replacing Ruling Class**: Neothink movement aims to replace society of masses with Neothink Society of self-leaders
- **Depoliticization**: Self-leaders require Prime Law political structure removing man from ruling
- **Freedom and Prosperity**: Nation of self-leaders enjoys great prosperity, limitless growth, ultimate freedom
- **Biological Immortality**: Self-leader mentality creates psychological foundation and demand for defeating aging

## ‚öñÔ∏è **PRIMARY VS SECONDARY VALUES**

*Understanding the fundamental hierarchy of the Neothink movement: Self-Improvement leads to Entrepreneurship*

### **Primary Value: Self-Improvement (Virtuously Selfish Movement)**

#### **Foundation of the Movement**
- **Neothink Movement Definition**: The movement "to improve one's life" and "improve oneself in order to live a better life"
- **The Journey**: 12-level journey designed to open the door "to the person you were meant to be" and release human potential
- **Virtuously Selfish**: Improving one's life is the "virtuously selfish movement" - the essential foundation for everything else
- **Prerequisite for All Else**: Without the shift from value producer to value creator (the psychological cure), the person lacks emotional drive to pursue longevity or world change

#### **Happiness as Internal Outcome**
- **Stagnation vs Creation**: Stagnation (opposite of value creation) kills the conscious mind and prevents happiness
- **Value Creation Formula**: "Value creation brings values to society and pride and happiness to oneself"
- **Eternal Exhilaration**: The creative life experiences new exhilaration each day and never wants to end
- **Core Curriculum**: Focuses on becoming the creative, wealthy, happy person we were meant to be

### **Secondary Value: Entrepreneurship (Virtuously Selfless Movement)**

#### **Application and Societal Goal**
- **Society Improvement**: The move to improve society is the "virtuously selfless movement"
- **TVP/Society Goal**: Championed by Twelve Visions Party (TVP) and Society's entrepreneurship focus
- **Value Creation for Society**: Bringing new values to society leads to legitimate power and prestige
- **Business Engine**: Uses business and marketing to drive societal change forward

#### **The Inevitable Connection**
- **Creating Demand**: Self-improvement movement creates the demand for longer life and better society
- **Joined Path**: Personal success and Neothink goal "can and will eventually join together"
- **Final Step**: Once person breaks through into value creation (happiness), they discover "deeper love for life that is eternal"
- **Passionate Pursuit**: At breakthrough point, they "will pursue with a passion a superpuzzle laid out in the Society" (large-scale virtuously selfless mission)

### **The Complete Formula**
```
Self-Improvement (Internal) ‚Üí Happiness & Wealth ‚Üí Entrepreneurship (External) ‚Üí Societal Value
    |                                |                      |                        |
Virtuously Selfish              Value Creation         Virtuously Selfless    Better World
    |                                |                      |                        |
Personal Transformation    ‚Üí    Sustainable Joy    ‚Üí    External Contribution  ‚Üí  Civilization Advancement
```
